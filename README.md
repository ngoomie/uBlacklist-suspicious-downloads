# uBlacklist filters for suspicious downloads
A uBlacklist filter list to remove websites offering suspicious downloads from appearing in search results. Meant to cover a wide variety of things, from those websites that mirror software only to add installers that include PUPs, to sites that offer downloads of lone DLLs that likely have viruses tacked on.

Please open an issue if you find a site that should be here that isn't, or also if something is listed here but is actually fine.

## Installation
Add the following link to your filter subscriptions in uBlacklist:
