# uBlacklist filters for suspicious downloads
A uBlacklist filter list to remove websites offering suspicious downloads from appearing in search results. Meant to cover a wide variety of things, from those websites that mirror software only to add installers that include PUPs, to sites that offer downloads of lone DLLs that likely have viruses tacked on.

## Installation
Add the following link to your filter subscriptions in uBlacklist:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngoomie/uBlacklist-suspicious-downloads/main/list.txt`

## Contributing
If you find a website that should be here but isn't, please open an issue or create a PR. The same applies if a website is here that shouldn't be.

If you want to help but don't know how, a good way to find things to add is to intentionally search for certain topics that consistently will return suspicious results ("download dll file" or the like), or to search for legit software and ignore all the official download links (i.e. Firefox or other browsers).
